      At MHSS, the NSS unit actively involves students in various activities that help develop their skills and values.

    <h3>Haritha Bhoomi</h3>
    <p>
As part of fostering agricultural knowledge among students, vegetables were planted in the homes of participating village residents. This hands-on initiative aimed to promote sustainable farming practices and encourage students to develop practical skills in agriculture. By engaging in home gardening, students gained firsthand experience in cultivating vegetables, learning about soil preparation, plant care, and the importance of growing their own food. The program not only enhanced their understanding of agriculture but also promoted healthy eating habits and environmental awareness within the community.
